# DataCamp
These are courses that I have completed for Data Scientist with Python track. Keeping a record and also practice using github. 

Unlike coursera, datacamp has hints that usually is sufficient to help figure out the solutions. I am sure most people have the integrity to not simply copy answer to accumulate certificates. Your work speaks for itself so there is no need to use the solutions here unless you really can't figure out the answer.
